CauseHF: Stock Portfolio Generation witH Recurrent Neural Networks
------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains tools to produce stock portfolios which
optimize various measures, such as the Sharpe ratio, using recurrent
neural networks.

To do:
------
* Check licenses.
* Clean code.
* Add fake data.
  * Add to package_data in setup.py.
* Improve READMEs.
* Remove non-recurrent neural net.
* Put on github.
* Remove hooks.
* Test cleanly cloning the repository and running pip install -e .
* Consider speeding up tests.
